# gibb.eri.sh // Local Voice OS

**Your Mac, but it listens.**

gibb.eri.sh is a **context-aware Voice OS** that runs entirely on `localhost`.
It doesn't just transcribe; it sees what you're doing (coding, meeting, browsing) and executes relevant actions locally.

Zero-cloud. Zero-latency. 100% Rust.

## Why?

Most transcription apps send your audio to cloud APIs. This one doesn't.

It uses a zero-copy audio bus to stream microphone data directly to local AI models, bypassing the JavaScript bridge.

## Features

- **Private**: Audio processed locally, never uploaded
- **⚡️ Zero-Latency:** Words appear char-by-char as you speak (<200ms lag).
- **🧠 Context Engine:** Detects your active app (VS Code, Zoom) to enable relevant tools automatically.
- **🧠 Smart Turn Detection:** Uses semantic analysis (powered by **Daily.co VAD 3.1** logic) to know exactly when you've finished a sentence.
- **Voice commands**: Local LLM (FunctionGemma) executes intents like "Search Wikipedia for..."
- **Context-aware modes**: Tools filtered by mode (Global, Dev, Meeting) before LLM inference
- **Hybrid inference**: Streaming (Sherpa) for instant feedback, batch (Parakeet/Whisper) for accuracy

## Requirements

- macOS 13+ (Apple Silicon recommended)
- Rust 1.70+
- Node.js 18+

## Architecture

The app follows clean architecture principles:

- **Domain Layer** (`crates/`) - Core business logic and traits
- **Infrastructure Layer** (`crates/storage`, `crates/parakeet`) - Concrete implementations
- **Application Layer** (`plugins/`) - Tauri plugins bridging UI and domain
- **Presentation Layer** (`apps/desktop/src/`) - React UI components

Key design decisions:
- `SttEngine` trait allows swapping speech recognition backends
- `TranscriptRepository` trait decouples storage from domain
- Service layer in plugins separates business logic from Tauri commands
- Zustand stores for frontend state management

## Models

gibb.eri.sh uses NVIDIA Parakeet models via ONNX Runtime:

| Model | Size | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Parakeet TDT 0.6B V2 | ~600MB | Fast, streaming-capable (Recommended) |
| Parakeet CTC 0.6B | ~600MB | Higher accuracy, batch processing |
| Parakeet TDT 1.1B | ~1.1GB | Best accuracy, requires more memory |
| Sherpa Zipformer (EN) | ~250MB | Low-latency streaming transducer (English) |
| **NeMo Conformer** | CTC | **Catalan** (Specialized) | ~500MB |

Models are downloaded on first use and cached in `~/Library/Application Support/gibberish/models/`.

## Usage

1. **First Launch** - Select and download a model in Settings
2. **Recording** - Click the record button or use the menu bar icon
3. **View Transcript** - Text appears in real-time during recording
4. **Browse Sessions** - Access past recordings in the Sessions tab
5. **Export** - Use the export menu to save as TXT, SRT, or JSON

## Development

```bash
# Run in development mode
cd apps/desktop
npm run tauri dev

# Check Rust compilation
cargo check -p notary-desktop

# Check TypeScript
npx tsc --noEmit

# Build for release
npm run tauri build
```
